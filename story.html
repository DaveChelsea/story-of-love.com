Location:- LANDON </big> </h3>
<pre> <big> <big>
		Armaan just arrived at the LANDON CITY AIRPORT, he came to Landon for a new english single.


		As he stepped out of airport everyone crowded him, as armaan is a global star & he has fans across world.


		Everyone was shouting armaan look here, armaan autograph please, armaan this armaan that and armaan armaan & armaannnn......


		Suddenly he saw👀 a girl who just stepped out of car...


		She was looking simple🙂, innocent😌 & beautiful😍.

		<b>

‌She was not at all mad😍 for him like others. She even haven't look that side😒

‌</b>
		<b>AM</b>:- (in mind💭) She must be an Indian girl.


<b>(As she has wore a royal blue color salwar suit & matching diamond earrings. Her hairs are open. Whereas others are in modern dresses)</b>

		<img src="cdress.jpg">

		<img src="cearrings.jpg">

<b>Hairs are black-n-brown, long & wavey. Her eyes are so deep like having so many secrets in it. Lips are rose pink & looks so soft like that of baby.</b>

		

‌Armaan was continuously staring her & has no sense for a while😳. Suddenly a fan tap on his shoulder saying (armaan please look here) again n again & he came back to sense.


		All his fans go after talking a little more to him. Some got hugs too🤗. Armaan was so happy. After that he again looked👀 at her, she was waiting for someone👤 & also she seems a little bit tensed😣 too.

		‌Looking her tensed he became a little sad & was like why she is tensed. It looks bad on her face.

		Armaan walked towards her, she saw him coming but not reacted anything like OMG... Wait! What, I can't believe etc(Like us😝). Because she don't know him


<b><i>While he was walking towards her</i> </b>

		<b>AM</b>:- (in mind) Who she  is, how I start talking to her😳, I guess she don't know who m I, Did she know me by my name only & haven't seen face ever🤷🏻‍♀️, what if she will go away without talking😱.... And so many more questions.


		In short our flirting boy is nervous & confuse. After all he don't want to make his first meeting with her worst.
<b><i>

At the same time</i></b>


		‌<b>S</b>:- (thinking) who is that guy coming towards me🧐 & who he is... why everyone crowded him? Is he a celebrity🤵...!

	<b>Armaan came and stand on her side & tap her left shoulder... she don't turn, Armaan again tap her shoulder & said...</b>

		<b>AM</b>:- Excuse me! Can u please tell me this address...?

		<b>SH</b>:- (with a little smile🙂) sure(also asked him) “ Are you from India...?”

		<b>AM</b>:- Yesss😀 I'm from India😁. How you know that😯!

		<b>SH</b>:- Because you look soo...

		<b>AM</b>:- Are you too from India?

		‌<b>SH</b>:- Yeah I'm also Indian.


Shravya suddenly realized that she was waiting for someone & again start looking towards the exit & even forgot to tell him her name & even address too.


		<b>AM</b>:- You are looking tensed😥 can I help you?

		<b>S</b>:- No... Thanks for asking☺. I'm just looking for someone.


		(After heraring that he thought that what if she is waiting for her boyfriend?...No that's not possible she seems so simple for all this kind of things...

		 What if she was waiting for her husband...! But if she belongs to hindu religion she must have atleast mangalsutra in her neck, so that also not possible but what if its true...

		 So is she waiting for her fiance... what is this thought of mine is true? Or maybe she is just waiting for her family or friends.

		 Sould I ask her? .....His heart reaplied just ask her.

		 Listening to his heart he take a little deep breath & asked her.....)

		<b>AM</b>:- If you don't mind can ask you a question?

		<b>S</b>:- Yes you can.... I'll not.

		<b>AM</b>:- Mmmm whom you are waiting for?(his heart started beating so fast, thinking that what if his doubt is true?)

		<b>S</b>:- (Tells in a soft tone)Well I'm waiting for someone I'm going to meet after years. I love him the most(Listening the word him his heart skiped a beat)....

		    (Tells a bit angerily)but first of all when he comes, I'll  scold him so much... No it's better that not to talk with him when he comes, (Tells in a soft but confusion tone)but I can't he is my

		    love(same time his heart skipped two beats & almost had a herat break, but, shravi add immediatly), he is my brother & he(<b>AM</b>) was like thank god and released a deep breath.

		<b>AM</b>:- Ohh! Ok. Where he is coming from?

		<b>S</b>:- India... But he is not arrived yet, I'm getting worried.


<b><i>At Home</i></b>


		<b>SDA</b>:- (To <b>SM</b>) Shravi aur Anmol kaha hai... Ye log abhi tak ghar kyu nhi aaye?

		‌<b>SM</b>:- Papa mujhe bhi nhi pata

		<b>SDA</b>:- Meri Raghu se baat kervao

Although she has a simple old phone but...)
